# Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) Project

This project implements a simple Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) using C. RNNs are a type of neural network particularly well-suited for sequence data,
making them useful for tasks such as natural language processing (NLP), time series analysis, and more.

## Overview

In this project, we build an RNN model in C to perform a specific task. We provide an example of using an RNN for sentiment analysis on movie reviews, although this model 
can be adapted for various sequence-based tasks.
